# My Full-Stack Web Project using MongoDB

I've been working on a project. It's all about ***Card Notes*** and sharing notes with your friends <br>
_**The project website deployed on render**_ -> [Card Notes](card-notes.render.com)
### Project Highlights :

- **Card Notes**: _Make_, _edit_, and _delete_ digital cards easily.
- **Share with** Friends: Send notes to your pals with a few clicks.
- **Authentication**: No fancy stuff, just using MongoDB's _id for user checks.

### What I've Learned:

- **Node.js and Express**: I became skilled in using Node.js and Express for server-side development.
- **Mongoose Schema and Models**: I learned to create schemas and models using Mongoose, making data management easier.
- **MongoDB Data Handling**: I discovered how to sort and work with data in MongoDB.
- **Full-Stack Progress**: I gained proficiency in full-stack development, using Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. I also integrated the bcrypt module for secure password hashing and grasped project deployment techniques.

This project is my way of sharing my web development skills and the exciting knowledge I've gained!.<br>
No sales pitch here, just my love for coding.
